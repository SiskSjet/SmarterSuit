## ðŸ› ï¸°Info

A small suit software update that prevents death due to malfunction of the suit.

The new suit update will now check some parameters when leaving a cockpit or after a respawn to eliminate potential sources of danger.
In addition, the speed is adjusted relative to the ship.

**helmet** (*will check every 30 ticks*.) 
* opened when enviroment with oxygen detected.
* closed when enviroment without oxygen detected.

**jetpack**
* enabled when no gravity detected or gravity detected and no ground in range.
* disabled when gravity detected and ground is in range.

**dampeners** (*only after respawn in the medical room*)
* enabled when ship is not moving or when no ground in range and in planetary gravity well.
* disabled when ship is moving.

**broadcast** (*only after respawn in the medical room*)
* enabled when the suit was broadcasting before the respawn.
* disabled when the suit was not broadcasting before the respawn.

## ðŸ› ï¸°Options

* **HaltedSpeedTolerance/HST** (*float*) - Option to adjust the speed tolerance that declares a ship specifies as not moving. *Default: 0.01*.
* **AlignToGravity/ATG** (*boolean*) - Option to align the player to the gravity vector when flying. *Default: false*.
* **AlignToGravityDelay/ATGD** (*float*) - Delay, after which the suit tries to align to gravity. . *Default: 312*.
